# [Language Detection Project](https://github.com/Tanisha2626/Language-Detection-SoC-/tree/main/Language%20Detection%20Project)

This is a language detection model using python. It can extract text from images using EasyOCR and detect the language in which the text has been written. 

## Description

The Seasons of Code project [Language Detection](https://github.com/Tanisha2626/Language-Detection-SoC-/tree/main/Language%20Detection%20Project) consisted of the four learning weeks and then a final week where we implemented the knowledge gained to make the project. The learning weeks are mentioned as follows-

[Week 1](https://github.com/Tanisha2626/Language-Detection-SoC-/tree/main/Week%201%20-%20Python%20Practice) - We learnt about the basics of python language and various python libraries. We solved few basic questions using python to get familiar with the language.

[Week 2](https://github.com/Tanisha2626/Language-Detection-SoC-/tree/main/Week%202%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms) - We learnt about the basic machine learning algorithms and how to implement. We covered logistic regression , linear regression and Naive Bayes Classifier. 

[Week 3](https://github.com/Tanisha2626/Language-Detection-SoC-/tree/main/Week%203%20-%20Natural%20Language%20Processing) - We learnt the basics of natural language processing and learnt to do various operations such as stemming lemmatization using NLTK library and learnt to use the Naive Bayes Classifier to create a basic spam classifier. 

[Week 4](https://github.com/Tanisha2626/Language-Detection-SoC-/tree/main/Week%204%20-%20EasyOCR) - We learnt about the Optical Character Recognition and used EasyOCR to extract text from various images. 

[Week 5](https://github.com/Tanisha2626/Language-Detection-SoC-/tree/main/Language%20Detection%20Project) - We implemented the knowledge of 4 weeks to create a language detection model in python using a Naive Bayes Classifier. It can can even extract text from various images using EasyOCR and predict their language. 


## Built with

- Programming Language - Python
- Python Library - Pandas

## Usage

Run the entire code in Google Collab and upload the appropiate data set or images attached with the code for the code to function properly.
Follow the instructions mentioned in the commented section at the end of project notebook file to detect the language of your own text or image :)
